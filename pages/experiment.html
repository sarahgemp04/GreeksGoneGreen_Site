  <h3>Inspiration</h3>
  <img src="" />
  At University of California San Diego (UCSD), we noticed that car pickup zones on campus typically have
  high levels of pollution. Cars that keep their engines on, while waiting to pick up pedestrians is a source
  of smog on campus. Smog consists of volatile organic carbons, particulate matter, nitrous oxide and sulfur gas,
  most of which can be present in tailpipe emissions. Smog continues to be a major source of pollution for
  cities with continuous stop start traffic. In developing nations, countries have taken to various programs
  to help reduce smog pollution within their streets. Some of the programs consist of odd-even license plate
  programs, smart light grids to prevent stop-start traffic, stricter tailpipe emissions standards, and other
  programs consist of subsidizing electric vehicles. These programs highlight the growing demand for new air
  pollution reduction strategies.
  <br>
  <br>

  GGG plans to investigate smog eating technology as a science on the UCSD campus area, while celebrating and
  promoting UCSD student art. We will do this by inviting local artists to create murals printed on a poster that
  chemically reacts with localized air pollutants, and displayed in passenger pickup areas. Greeks Gone Green
  project will research the products created by titanium dioxide’s reverse photocatalysis process that breaks down
  nitrous oxides into nitrate forms compounded with intermediates products.

  <h3>The Artist - Shashi Mostafa</h3>
  <div class="container" style="align-items: center; margin: 10px auto 10px auto;">
    <img src="../img/Shashi.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 200px; object-fit: cover;" />
  </div>
  The winning design titled "Ride or Die" was created by Shashi Mostafa, a visual arts media and sociology double
  major, who says that the photo “Ride or Die bluntly emphasizes the need for attention toward the current state of
  our environment by visually presenting our only two options: assume sustainable habits or see the end of many
  species including our own. We must hold institutions accountable for finding methods to reduce waste while
  maintaining accessibility, so everyone can lead environmentally conscious lives. In doing so, we will develop a
  new norm that will save future generations and cause them to believe we were absurd for slowly killing ourselves
  with pollution.” After the unveiling, you can contact Shashi and ask her permission.
  <br><br>
  Greeks Gone Green decided on the mural design at the beginning of this quarter and narrowed all the submissions
  we received during Fall quarter down to a top 5. With the help of UCAB, we narrowed the top 5 down to a top 2,
  of which UCAB and GGG both unanimously agreed to use Shashi's design. Shashi's design was taken locally here in
  San Diego and sends a message that hits home. The criteria for the winner was finding a design that inspires
  sustainable and environmentally friendly thinking. Both UCAB and GGG believe Shashi design’s shock factor will
  draw people in to read the plaque that describes the inspiration behind it.

  <h3>The Techmology</h3>
  The poster “eats smog” by leveraging photocatalysis, the scientific reaction behind the active surface
  treatment made and spray applied by PURETi.  The spray contains titanium dioxide, a catalyst activated by
  ultraviolet light, which transforms H2O into oxidizers that break apart pollution particles like nitrous oxide
  and nitrous dioxide, the primary bi-products of combustion. Greeks Gone Green will be conducting scientific
  experiments to analyze the effectiveness of the process over time. We will be working with Dr.
  Jonathan Slade and his laboratory to conduct monthly tests and will post findings on our website
  here <a href="#experiment">(check out below!)</a>. The majority of the student population is not aware that
  such technology exists. One of the major goals of the project is to raise student awareness about technologies
  that can reduce smog and create a healthier campus environment.
  <br><br>
  We were able to accomplish all of this with The Green Initiative Fund from the Student Sustainability Collective.
  We applied during their fall funding cycle, and received funding for our project during Fall quarter. Big shout
  out to University Centers Board, for helping us find a space in Price Center. We will be placing the mural on
  the west wall of the ATM shelter by Price Center. Jan Kiessel and Devaney Kerr are our faculty representatives
  for this project.
